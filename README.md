# Twitter-Shadow

This is an exercise for _React_ & _Typescript_ by building a very simple Twitter.

There is no backend involved and all the data is stored locally.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
